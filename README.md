# TASK DETAILS

## TASK1 : FILE INTEGRITY CHECKER
A File Integrity Checker (FIC) is a tool designed to monitor and verify the integrity of files by comparing their current state against a known good baseline.

### WHAT IS INTEGRITY?
Integrity is the protection of system data from intentional or accidental unauthorized changes.

TOOLS/PACKAGES USED : VS CODE, PYTHON, STREAMLIT, HASHLIB

SUPPORTING HASHING ALGORITHMS : MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512 

EXPECTED USER INPUT : TEXT/FILE & EXPECTED HASH

**Usage**: In the terminal type -> streamlit run task1_file_integrity.py

## TASK2 :  WEB APPLICATION VULNERABILITY SCANNER
A web application vulnerability scanner is a software program that performs automatic black-box testing on a web application and identifies security vulnerabilities.

### WHAT IS VULNERABILITY?
A vulnerability, as defined by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO 27002), is "a weakness of an asset or group of assets that can be exploited by one or more threats."

### WHAT IS SQL INJECTION?
SQL injection is a code injection technique used to attack data-driven applications, in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution (e.g. to dump the database contents to the attacker).

### WHAT IS XSS?
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.

## TASK3 : PENETRATION TESTING TOOLKIT
Penetration Testing Toolkit focused on web applications and network penetration testing find out vulnerabilities.

**PORT SCANNER**
A port scanner is an application designed to probe a server or host for open ports. 

TOOLS/PACKAGES USED : VS CODE, PYTHON, STREAMLIT, SOCKET, CONCURRENT

EXPECTED USER INPUT : IP ADDRESS OF A MACHINE TO SCAN

**Usage**: Go to the folder where for task3 main.py is located then open terminal. In the terminal type -> streamlit run main.py

**BRUTEFORCE SSH**
In cryptography, a brute-force attack consists of an attacker submitting many passwords or passphrases with the hope of eventually guessing correctly. The attacker systematically checks all possible passwords and passphrases until the correct one is found.

TOOLS/PACKAGES USED : VS CODE, PYTHON, STREAMLIT, PARAMIKO, ITERTOOLS

EXPECTED USER INPUT : IP ADDRESS OF A MACHINE, USERNAME

**Input**

## TASK4 :  ADVANCED ENCRYPTION TOOL
Advanced Encryption Tool is used to secure sensitive information.

Encryption and decryption are fundamental processes in cybersecurity that protect and secure data. Encryption is the process of converting plaintext into ciphertext using an algorithm and a key, making the data unreadable to unauthorized parties.
Decryption, on the other hand, is the reverse process where ciphertext is converted back into plaintext using a decryption algorithm and a key, allowing authorized users to access and understand the encrypted data.

TOOLS/PACKAGES USED : VS CODE, PYTHON, STREAMLIT, PYCRYPTODOME, OS

EXPECTED USER INPUT : FILE TO ENCRYPT

ENCRYPTION ALGORITHMS : "AES-256", "Blowfish", "RSA"
FILETYPES ALLOWED : "txt", "jpg", "png", "pdf"

**Usage**: In the terminal type -> streamlit run task4_encryption_decryption_tool.py
