## TASK2 :  WEB APPLICATION VULNERABILITY SCANNER

### WHAT IS VULNERABILITY?
A vulnerability, as defined by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO 27002), is "a weakness of an asset or group of assets that can be exploited by one or more threats."

### WHAT IS SQL INJECTION?
SQL injection is a code injection technique used to attack data-driven applications, in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution (e.g. to dump the database contents to the attacker).

### WHAT IS XSS?
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.
